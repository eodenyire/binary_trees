# 0x1D. C - Binary Trees

## Overview

This repository contains solutions for the tasks in the `0x1D. C - Binary Trees` section of the ALX Low-Level Programming sprint. The tasks focus on the implementation and manipulation of binary trees in C programming.

## Tasks

1. **Is Binary Heap**
   - Prototype: `int binary_tree_is_heap(const binary_tree_t *tree);`
   - Checks if a binary tree is a valid Max Binary Heap.

2. **Heap - Insert**
   - Prototype: `heap_t *heap_insert(heap_t **root, int value);`
   - Inserts a value in Max Binary Heap.

3. **Heap - Array to Binary Heap**
   - Prototype: `heap_t *array_to_heap(int *array, size_t size);`
   - Builds a Max Binary Heap tree from an array.

4. **Heap - Extract**
   - Prototype: `int heap_extract(heap_t **root);`
   - Extracts the root node of a Max Binary Heap.

5. **Heap - Sort**
   - Prototype: `int *heap_to_sorted_array(heap_t *heap, size_t *size);`
   - Converts a Binary Max Heap to a sorted array of integers.

6. **Big O #Binary Heap**
   - Determines the average time complexities of operations on a Binary Heap:
     - Inserting the value n
     - Extracting the root node
     - Searching for a node in a binary heap of size n
